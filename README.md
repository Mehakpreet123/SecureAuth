# SecureAuth
SecureAuth is a secure authentication system designed and implemented using core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) principles. The system replicates the functionality of widely used authenticator apps (like Google Authenticator) with a custom backend that integrates hashing, encryption, and much more.
